# Angular-Basics


`APM-Basics`: The starter files set up for use in VSCode, WebStorm, or other editors. (Updated for <i>Angular version 10 or higher</i>)


See the `README.md` file under each folder for details on installing and running the application.


## INSTALLING THE CODE

The following are detailed instructions for installing the code.

0) Ensure you have node installed.

   At a command prompt, type `node -v` to ensure you have version `10.16.0` or higher before proceeding.

1) Download or clone the code from this repository.

   If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

2) Navigate to the Angular Basics folder.

   There should be a package.json file in this folder.

3) In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type `npm install`.

   This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.
   
4) In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type `npm start`.

   The application should then compile and launch in your default browser.
